# LeetCode Solutions by Aditya Bahe

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions! 🚀 This repository contains my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized by topic and difficulty. These solutions are written in [your programming language(s) C++, Java].

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── Sliding_Window/
│   ├── Easy/
│   │   ├── problem_1_example.py
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── Medium/
│   │   ├── problem_2_example.cpp
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── Hard/
│   │   ├── problem_3_example.java
│   │   └── ...
├── Dynamic_Programming/
│   ├── Easy/
│   │   ├── problem_4_example.py
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── Medium/
│   │   ├── problem_5_example.cpp
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── Hard/
│   │   ├── problem_6_example.java
│   │   └── ...
├── README.md
```

Each topic folder contains subfolders for `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard` problems, and files are named using the format `problem_<number>_<problem-name>.<extension>` for easy identification.

## 🛠️ Features
